### Definitions
Route: is the code you write on the server that defines what happens when you visite the endpoint.
Endpoint: is a specific HTTP method + URL path that the client requests.

    What a router actually does:
        -> Matches HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) + URL path
        -> Runs middleware in order
        -> Calls the controller

### in terms of directories:
    **routes** → decides which function runs for a given HTTP method and URL
    **controllers** → the functions implementations that actually does the work.
        The function usually handles (request/response) logic for an endpoint.

### Difference between Node.js (js vanilla) & Express
    Express provides simple methods that faciliates so many tasks.
```
| Feature      | Raw Node.js                  | Express                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Routing      | Manual (`req.url`)           | `app.get()` / `app.post()`  |
| Parsing JSON | Manual (`req.on('data')`)    | `express.json()` middleware |
| Cookies      | Manual (`Set-Cookie` header) | `res.cookie()` helper       |
| Middleware   | Manual functions             | `app.use()`                 |

# Auth Controller Documentation

This document explains the functions inside `auth.controllers.ts` located in the `Backend/src/controllers` directory. These functions handle user authentication logic for the MERN Chat App backend.

## Functions Overview

### 1. `signup`

**Purpose:**  
Handles new user registration.

**How it works:**  
- Receives `fullName`, `email`, and `password` from the request body.
- Validates that all fields are present and the password is at least 6 characters.
- Checks if a user with the given email already exists.
- Hashes the password using bcrypt.
- Creates a new user document and saves it to the database.
- Generates a JWT token for the new user.
- Returns a success response with the new user's ID and name, or an error message if registration fails.

---

### 2. `login`

**Purpose:**  
Authenticates an existing user.

**How it works:**  
- Receives `email` and `password` from the request body.
- Validates that both fields are present.
- Finds the user by email.
- Compares the provided password with the stored hashed password using bcrypt.
- If authentication succeeds, generates a JWT token.
- Returns a success response with the user's ID and name, or an error message if login fails.

---

### 3. `logout`

**Purpose:**  
Logs out the current user.

**How it works:**  
- Clears the authentication token by setting the `jwt` cookie to an empty value.
- Returns a success response indicating the user has been logged out.

---

### 4. `editProfile`

**Purpose:**  
Allows the authenticated user to update their profile picture.

**How it works:**  
- Retrieves the user's ID from the request (set by authentication middleware).
- Receives `profilePicture` from the request body.
- Validates that a picture is provided.
- Uploads the new profile picture to Cloudinary.
- Updates the user's `profilePic` field in the database with the new image URL.
- Returns the updated user document or an error message if the update fails.


# Socket Integration Documentation

## Sockets Overview

Socket.IO is a javascript library that allows two-way communication between your Node.js server and your web client

Socket.IO does not create its own HTTP server, it attaches itself to an existing Node HTTP server.

## Steps Overview

### 1. creating http server

`const app = express()`: returns a function that handles routing logic for the HTTP requests.
`app.listen(PORT)` will create a server internally that we dont have access to.

> That’s a problem for sockets: WebSockets require access to the HTTP server instance inorder to attach WebSocket listeners.

thats why we switch to using the `const server = createServer(app)` to create an http server.
